Please describe.\n\nI would like to suggest adding native support for uploading **Minecraft maps** to Modrinth.\n\nCurrently, Modrinth supports mods, resource packs, shaders, and modpacks, but map creators do not have a dedicated project type. Adding map support would allow developers to distribute adventure, survival, parkour, and other custom maps directly on the platform.\n\n### Benefits\n- Provides a first-class place for map developers to publish their work  \n- Centralises map downloads on Modrinth instead of external file hosts linked in a description\n- Enables proper versioning, changelogs, and update management (some resource packs are made specifically for maps, so there is a slight disconnect)\n- Allows tagging, categorization, and Minecraft version compatibility  \n- Improves discoverability for players  \n\n### Suggested Implementation\n- Introduce a new **Map** project type (right now we have *mods, resource packs, shaders, and modpacks*)\n- Support `.zip` world uploads  \n- Include required fields such as:\n  - Minecraft version(s)\n  - Map category/type\n  - Singleplayer / Multiplayer compatibility (adventure maps for example)\n- Optional linking of required resource packs or data packs  \n\nAdding map support would help make Modrinth a more complete platform for Minecraft creators and players alike.\n\n### Describe the solution you'd like\n\n_No response_\n\n### Describe alternatives you've considered\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional context\n\n_No response_",
